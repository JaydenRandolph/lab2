# Lab 2: Seven Segment Display Decoder

VHDL for ECE 281 [Lab 2](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/lab/lab2.html)

Targeted toward Digilent Basys3. Tested Vivado 2024.2

# Documentation
I used ChatGPT to try to understand a lot of the syntax for the implementation segment of this lab. NO CODE WAS DIRECTLY USED FROM CHATGPT!! 
All code was 100% written by me; I used ChatGPT to try to figure out where I was getting stuck on the implementation portion since
I don't fully understand how VHDL works, but as you can see in the conversation thread it was very unhelpful. Even though it gives a lot
of code in the conversation, none of the code was used in the lab and the conversation was used so I could understand how to implement my
implementation sketch into VHDL.
